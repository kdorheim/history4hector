# Map CEDS emissions to hector units , this should probably map all the CEDS sectors to the RCMIP aggregation but we are short ontime ,,,,,
# cf is the conversion factor from CEDS to Hector,,,,,,
# the total column indicates if the emissions are complete for all sectors 1 or need to be aggregaed with additional sources 0,,,,,,
