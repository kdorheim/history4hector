# Map BB4CMIP emissions to hector units , this should probably map all the CEDS sectors to the RCMIP aggregation but we are short ontime ,,,,,,,,
# cf is the conversion factor from BB4CMIP to Hector,,,,,,,,,
# the total column indicates if the emissions are complete for all sectors 1 or need to be aggregaed with additional sources 0,,,,,,,,,
